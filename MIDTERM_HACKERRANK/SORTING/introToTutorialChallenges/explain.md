This challenge is super straightforward. I’m given a sorted array and a target value V. My job is to return the index of V in that array.

Since the array is already sorted and contains V exactly once, I don’t need to do any fancy searching like binary search. I can just loop through or use a built-in method to find the index.

I use indexOf()—it scans the array and returns the position of the first match.
