The **superReducedString function** is designed to simplify a given string by removing adjacent pairs of identical characters. It uses a stack—a data structure that follows a **"last in, first out"** principle—to keep track of characters as it iterates through the string. For each character, the function checks whether the top of the stack matches the current character. If they are the same, it means a pair has been found, so the top character is removed (or "popped") from the stack. If they are different, the current character is added (or "pushed") onto the stack. This process continues until all characters have been examined. At the end, if the stack is empty, it means all characters were successfully paired and removed, so the function returns **"Empty String"**. Otherwise, it joins the remaining characters in the stack and returns the reduced string. This approach ensures that all adjacent duplicates are eliminated efficiently, even if removing one pair reveals another.
