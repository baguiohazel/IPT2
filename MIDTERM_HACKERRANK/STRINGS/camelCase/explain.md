First, I understand the format:

The string is a combination of words.

The first word starts with a lowercase letter.

Every new word after that starts with an uppercase letter.

Then, I loop through each character in the string.

I check if the character is uppercase.

If it is, that means a new word has started.

So I increase the wordCount by 1.

Since the first word is lowercase, I start with wordCount = 1.

Finally, I return the total number of words found.
