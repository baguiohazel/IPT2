Set a pointer(q) to track your position in the word "hackerrank".

Loop through each character in the input string s.

If the current character matches the current letter in "hackerrank", move the pointer(q) forward.

If you reach the end of "hackerrank" (i.e., all letters matched), return "YES".

If the loop ends and you havenâ€™t matched all letters, return "NO".
