First, I create a variable called count and set it to zero. This will keep track of the total number of operations needed to turn the string into a palindrome.

Next, I store the length of the string in a variable n so I can use it multiple times without recalculating.

Then, I run a loop starting from the end of the string (n - 1) moving backward until I reach the middle of the string (Math.floor(n / 2)). This way, I compare characters from the end toward the center.

Inside the loop, I get the ASCII code of the character at position i using charCodeAt. This gives me a numeric value to work with.

I calculate the difference between this character and its mirrored character on the other side of the string using Math.abs. This tells me how many steps it takes to make these two characters the same.

I add that difference to my count because each step counts as an operation.

Once the loop finishes, I return the total count, which represents the minimum number of operations needed to make the string a palindrome.
