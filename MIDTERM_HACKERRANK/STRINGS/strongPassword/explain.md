First, I set up a counter count = 0 to track how many character types are missing.

Then, I use regular expressions to check if the password contains:

At least one lowercase letter → /[a-z]/

At least one uppercase letter → /[A-Z]/

At least one digit → /\d/

At least one special character → /[!@#$%^&*()\-+]/

For each missing type, I increase the count by 1.

Next, I check if the password is shorter than 6 characters.

If it is, I calculate how many characters are needed to reach 6.

Finally, I return the maximum between:

The number of missing character types (count)

The number of characters needed to reach length 6 (6 - n)
