I start by giving every child 1 candy. That’s the minimum requirement.

Then I do two passes through the ratings:

(Left to Right)
I check each child against the one before them. If their rating is higher, I give them one more candy than the previous child.

(Right to Left)
I check each child against the one after them. If their rating is higher and they don’t already have more candies, I update their candy count to be one more than the next child.

After both passes, I add up all the candies. That’s the minimum total Alice needs to buy.
