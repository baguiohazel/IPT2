Count Frequencies:
The code first counts how many times each number appears in arrays A and B.

Find Beautiful Pairs:
For each unique number in A, it checks if that number exists in B. If it does, it adds the minimum count of that number from both arrays to the pairs count. This ensures pairs are pairwise disjoint (no repeated indices).

Change One Element in B:
If all elements in A are already paired (pairs === A.length), changing one element in B will reduce the number of pairs by 1.
Otherwise, you can increase the number of pairs by 1 by changing one element in B to match an unpaired element in A.
