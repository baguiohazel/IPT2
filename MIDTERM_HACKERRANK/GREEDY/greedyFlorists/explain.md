To solve this, I first sorted the flower prices from highest to lowest, because it’s cheapest to buy the expensive flowers before the price multiplier increases. Then, I looped through the sorted prices, and for each flower, I calculated how many flowers that friend had already bought using Math.floor(i / k). I multiplied the flower’s price by that number plus one, and added it to the total cost. This way, I made sure each friend took turns buying, and the total cost stayed as low as possible.
