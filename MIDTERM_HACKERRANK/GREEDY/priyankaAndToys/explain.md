I sort the toys to make grouping easier.
I always start a new container with the lightest remaining toy.
I pack as many toys as possible into each container, as long as theyâ€™re within 4 units of the lightest toy in that container.
I keep going until all toys are packed, and then I return the number of containers I needed.
