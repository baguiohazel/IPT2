I sort the cupcake calorie list in descending order. That way, the highest-calorie cupcakes come first.

the highest-calorie cupcake first, then the next highest, and so on. Each time one cupcake is eaten, I multiply its calories by 2𝑖, where 𝑖 is the number of cupcakes that is already eaten.

I add up all those values. That total is the number of miles Marc has to walk.
