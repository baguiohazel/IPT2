I start by sorting each row of the grid alphabetically. That’s allowed—only rows can be rearranged, not columns.

Once all rows are sorted, I check each column from top to bottom. For every column, I make sure the letters are in ascending order.

If all columns pass the check, I return "YES". If even one column fails, I return "NO".
