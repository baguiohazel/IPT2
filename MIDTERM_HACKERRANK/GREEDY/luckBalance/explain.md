I separate the contests into two types:
Important contests (marked with 1)
Unimportant contests (marked with 0)

I always lose the unimportant ones. That’s free luck—no restrictions.

For the important contests, I sort them by luck in descending order. That way, the highest-luck contests come first.

I’m allowed to lose up to k important contests. So I lose the top k ones to gain the most luck.

The rest of the important contests—I win them. That means I subtract their luck from my total.
