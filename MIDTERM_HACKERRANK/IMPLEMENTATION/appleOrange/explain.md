First, I set up two counters: appleCount and orangeCount, both starting at zero.

Then I loop through the apples array. Each apple has a value that represents how far it fell from the apple tree, which is located at position a. So I add a + apples[i] to get the actual landing spot of each apple.

I check if that landing spot is between s and t. If it is, I increment appleCount by one.

I do the same thing for oranges. I loop through the oranges array, and each orange fell from tree b. So I calculate b + oranges[j] to get its landing position.

Again, I check if that position is within the house range. If yes, I increment orangeCount.

Finally, I print both counts using console.log, so I can see how many apples and oranges landed on the house.
