Using the function designerPdfViewer I used it to loop through each character in the input word, convert it to an index by doing charCodeAt(0) - 97, and track the maximum height I see in the h array. Once I know the tallest letter, I multiply that height by the number of letters in the word (since each letter is 1 mm wide) and return the product. If all letters are short, the max stays low and the area is small; if thereâ€™s a really tall letter, that drives the whole area.
