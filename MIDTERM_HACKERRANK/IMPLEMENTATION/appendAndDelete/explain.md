 I first needed to figure out the most efficient way to transform  s into  t. I realized that finding the longest common prefix was key, as that part wouldn't need any changes. Then, I calculated the minimum number of operations (deletions and appends) needed based on that prefix. Finally, I implemented the logic to check if the given number of operations k was sufficient, considering the special cases where extra operations could be used to "pad" the transformation or when completely rebuilding the string was an option.
