I use the functiuon beautifulDays to loop from the start day i to the end day j. For each day, I turn it into a string, split and reverse its characters, then parse it back into a number. I take the absolute difference between the original and the reversed number, and if that difference modulo k is zero, I increment my counter. At the end, count holds exactly how many beautiful days there are.
