First, I set a counter called ways to zero. This will keep track of how many ways Lily can divide the chocolate.

Then, I use a loop to look at every possible segment of the chocolate bar that has a length equal to Ron’s birth month (m). For each segment, I calculate the sum of its numbers.

If the sum of the segment equals Ron’s birth day (d), I increase the ways counter by one.

After checking all possible segments, I return the total number of ways (ways) that the chocolate can be divided to match the conditions.
