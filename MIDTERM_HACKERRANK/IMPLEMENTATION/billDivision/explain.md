First, I go through the bill and add up the cost of all the items except the one Anna didn’t eat (using the index k). This gives me the total amount Anna should actually pay for.

Then, I divide that total by 2, since Anna and Brian are splitting the cost of the items Anna ate. This gives me Anna’s fair share.

Finally, I compare Anna’s fair share to the amount Brian actually charged her (b).

If they are the same, I print "Bon Appetit" to show Brian charged her correctly.
If not, I print the difference, which is the amount Brian needs to refund to Anna.
