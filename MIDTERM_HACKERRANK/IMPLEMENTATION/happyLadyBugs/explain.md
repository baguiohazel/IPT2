So first, I loop through the string to check if there’s any underscore—because if there’s no empty cell, I can’t rearrange anything, and that means the current layout must already be happy. I then scan each bug to see if it has a neighbor of the same color; if any bug is isolated, I return "NO". But if there are underscores, I know I can move bugs around, so I count how many times each color appears. If any color appears only once, that bug can’t be grouped and will stay unhappy, so I return "NO" again. If all colors appear at least twice, then I can rearrange them to make everyone happy, and I return "YES"
