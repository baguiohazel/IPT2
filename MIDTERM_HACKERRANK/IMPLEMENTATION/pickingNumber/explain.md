First, I made a frequency array to count how many times each number shows up. Then I checked each number and added its count with the count of the number right before it—because those two can be grouped together if their difference is just 1. I kept track of the biggest total I found, and in the end, I returned that number. That’s the size of the largest group that follows the rule.
