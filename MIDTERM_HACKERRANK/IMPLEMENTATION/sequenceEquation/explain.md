1. The function initializes an empty array called result to store the final output.
2. It then uses a for loop to iterate through each integer i from 1 to the length of the array p (inclusive).
3. Inside the loop, it finds the index of the integer i in the array p using the indexOf method. Since array indices are zero-based, it adds 1 to the result to get the correct position (firstIndex).
4. Next, it finds the index of firstIndex in the array p, again using indexOf and adding 1 to get the correct position (secondIndex).
5. The secondIndex is then pushed into the result array.
6. After the loop completes, the function returns the result array containing the sequence equation for each integer from 1 to n.
