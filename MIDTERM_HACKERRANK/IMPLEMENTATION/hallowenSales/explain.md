I start with the initial price and a counter for games bought.
As long as I have enough money to buy the next game, I subtract the price from my budget and increase the games bought counter.
After each purchase, I reduce the price by the discount, but never let it go below the minimum price.
I repeat this process until I can't afford another game.
Then, I return the total number of games bought.
