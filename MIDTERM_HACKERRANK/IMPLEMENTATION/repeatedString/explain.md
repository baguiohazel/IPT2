I created a helper function countA to count the number of "a"s in any given string. This makes the code cleaner and easier to read.

I figured out how many times the original string s is fully repeated within the desired length n. I used Math.floor(n / s.length) to get this number.

Since the repeated string might not perfectly fit the desired length n, I calculated the length of the remaining part using the modulo operator: n % s.length.

I multiplied the number of "a"s in the original string (using countA(s)) by the number of full repeats.

I then counted the number of "a"s in the remaining part of the string (using countA(s.slice(0, remainder))).

Then, I added these two counts together to get the total number of "a"s in the repeated string.
