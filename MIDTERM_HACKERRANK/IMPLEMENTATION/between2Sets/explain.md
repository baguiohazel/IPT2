To solve this problem, I want to find all the numbers that are “between” the two arrays. That means every number I pick must be a multiple of all the numbers in the first array, and it must also be a factor of all the numbers in the second array.

To do this, I first find the LCM (Least Common Multiple) of the first array. This gives me the smallest number that all elements in the first array divide evenly.

Next, I find the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the second array. This gives me the largest number that divides all elements in the second array.

Now, I look for all the numbers between the LCM and the GCD that are multiples of the LCM and also divide the GCD evenly. For each number that fits, I count it.

The final count is the answer: it’s the number of integers that are “between” the two sets as described in the problem.
