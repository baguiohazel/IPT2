First and foremost, we have to find the biggest numbers in an array, that can be achieved by using Math.max() function, passing the array in to Math function will return the biggest number.

After that, we are invoking array.Filter() function, using this we are comparing each element in an array with Biggest Number returned by Math.max and store the numbers in new array.

Finally, we are returning the length from new array.
